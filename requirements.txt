#Great! I'm glad the NFC cracker is working well in simulation mode for you. Here's a summary of what you've accomplished:
# You've successfully set up the NFC cracker project with all the necessary files
# You've modified the requirements to use Windows-compatible packages
# You've run the tool in simulation mode and seen how it detects and cracks MIFARE Classic cards
# What You Can Do Next:
# Explore different attack methods using the advanced_attacks.py script with the simulation flag
# Customize the code if you want to add new features or attack methods
# Use with real hardware if you ever get an NFC reader (like an ACR122U)
# Key Files in Your Project:
# nfc_cracker.py: The main script for basic card analysis and cracking
# advanced_attacks.py: Implementation of more sophisticated attack methods
# nfc_utils.py: Utility functions for working with different card types
# requirements.txt: Lists all the Python dependencies
# Basic card analysis with simulation
# python nfc_cracker.py --simulation

# # Advanced attacks with simulation
# python advanced_attacks.py --attack nested --simulation
# python advanced_attacks.py --attack darkside --simulation
# python advanced_attacks.py --attack mfoc --simulation
# python advanced_attacks.py --attack ultralight --simulation

# # Continuous scanning
# python nfc_cracker.py --simulation --continuous
